There are three example levels. Sprites, objects, and rooms are grouped into folders to represent each of the examples. To access a specific example, drag the associated room to the top of the room list in GameMaker.

The controller objects randomly populate the rooms with objects to tile. They then autotile the objects (and display how long it takes to autotile all the objects).

Use the arrow keys to navigate around the room.
